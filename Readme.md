# Designing GUI Apps with Kivy MD
2/05/2024

In this repo I revisit Kivymd framework and learn more about how to create gui apps for mobile. 

I follow and use the tutorials 17 - 22 from the playlist [Kivy Tutorial - Building Games and mobile Apps with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AhjxG1ypJs&list=PLhTjy8cBISEpobkPwLm71p5YNBzPH9m9V&index=23), on the `buildwithhpython` channel. And these are just a refresher to get me started with the major concepts like:
- labels
- buttons
- images
- setting the boiler code for each project i will build
- layouts (Box, Grid, & Nested layouts)
- Getting text input from the user through the gui app

After these I continue to implement some advanced concepts with another playlist [Kivy Tutorial - Building Mobile Apps with Python | KivyMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRXo0juuTrw&list=PLhTjy8cBISEoQQLZ9IBlVlr4WjVoStmy-&index=1) as my guide from the same channel.
